# Ixian-DLT-GUI

Settings that are marked with RED - can't be ignored. All other is native. 

With update process, all DLT-directory files will be wiped. Keep your blockchain and wallet in another place.

Use external blockchain directory  - select directory with '\data\...' (or '\data-testnet\...') inside. Otherwise '\data\..' will be created as usual in DLT-node directory.

If no external wallet file selected - it will be created in main (DLT) directory. DON'T forget to BACKUP is after first start and keep it in other place.

Software detects your LOCAL IP and PUBLIC IP automatically, so just check if it is right.
